This index is sorted by subject. **Background** will usually include resources which provide information on the underlying principles and tools behind a field, while **Learning** specifically covers security challenges in that field. **Practice** holds CTFs, wargames, puzzles, and other concrete ways to test your skills.

## General

### Learning

* [https://tryhackme.com/] Highly guided, highly comprehensive, highly beginner-friendly.

### Practice

* [https://www.hackthebox.com/] A very comprehensive collection of CTFS and challenges, but take note that its "Starting Point" tutorials will not teach you the concepts behind the commands they tell you to input; they also operate an "Academy" platform for that purpose, which is also highly comprehensive, but depending on your learning pace and style you may run into subscription barriers.
** Of course, it's able to be as comprehensive as it is because it has a subscription model. Most similar platforms, listed below in this section, will be much more freely available, but also much less polished.
* [https://echoctf.red/] Another general-purpose CTF website, with some tutorials and guidance provided. As someone's passion project, much less comprehensive than HTB.
* The following sites host wargames with very little guidance or none at all. You're assumed to understand what to do on your own.
    * [https://www.smashthestack.org/main.html]
    * [https://w3challs.com/]
    * [https://pwnable.kr/]
    * [https://pwnable.tw/]
    * [https://pwnable.xyz/]
    * [https://www.hackthissite.org/]
    * [https://overthewire.org/wargames/] Not much explicit guidance, but structured in a very careful, slow-rolled way. You may not need much prior knowledge if you're comfortable with self-directed learning.

## Cryptography

* [https://cryptohack.org/] Comprehensive, well-presented learning resources and puzzles with very little mathematical background as a prerequisite. Familiarity with Python or another scripting language is necessary.

This index is sorted by subject. **Background** will usually include resources which provide information on the underlying principles and tools behind a field, while **Learning** specifically covers security challenges in that field. **Practice** holds CTFs, wargames, puzzles, and other concrete ways to test your skills. **Reading** is interesting material related to the subject which isn't intended to be used for structured learning.

## General

### Background

These resources are mainly for skills you may not have acquired, or not acquired well, in introductory CS classes.

#### Practice

* https://regexcrossword.com/

### Learning

* https://tryhackme.com/ Highly guided, highly comprehensive, highly beginner-friendly.
* https://www.hacker101.com/ Offers video lessons, if that works better for you.

### Practice

* https://www.hackthebox.com/ A very comprehensive collection of CTFS and challenges, but take note that its "Starting Point" tutorials will not teach you the concepts behind the commands they tell you to input; they also operate an "Academy" platform for that purpose, which is also highly comprehensive, but depending on your learning pace and style you may run into subscription barriers.
    * Of course, it's able to be as comprehensive as it is because it has a subscription model. Most similar platforms, listed below in this section, will be much more freely available, but also much less polished.
* https://echoctf.red/ Another general-purpose CTF website, with some tutorials and guidance provided. As someone's passion project, much less comprehensive than HTB.
* The following sites host wargames with very little guidance or none at all. You're assumed to understand what to do on your own.

This index is sorted by subject. **Background** will usually include resources which provide information on the underlying principles and tools behind a field, while **Learning** specifically covers security challenges in that field. **Practice** holds CTFs, wargames, puzzles, and other concrete ways to test your skills.

## General

### Practice

* [https://www.hackthebox.com/] A very comprehensive collection of CTFS and challenges, but take note that its "Starting Point" tutorials will not teach you the concepts behind the commands they tell you to input; they also operate an "Academy" platform for that purpose, which is also highly comprehensive, but depending on your learning pace and style you may run into subscription barriers.
** Of course, it's able to be as comprehensive as it is because it has a subscription model. Most similar platforms, listed below in this section, will be much more freely available, but also much less polished.

## Cryptography

* [https://cryptohack.org/] Comprehensive, well-presented learning resources and puzzles with very little mathematical background as a prerequisite. Familiarity with Python or another scripting language is necessary.
